"""Moved the check of soles against maximum tickets into it's own function
Added lists to hold ticket holder's name and the price paid for their ticket
Added a dictionary to get data from these 2 new lists Added code to append name
and ticket price to the new lists (line 137 and 138) Added the import re and
import pandas libraries (installing pandas package if necessary)
Added the print statement for ticket profit on line 151 Modified the 'else'
statements under 'if MAX_TICKETS - ticket_count â€º 1:' (previously occupied
lines 158-160) to improve flow and readability Added the print details
(movie_frame: bottom 3 lines) which uses the pandas library to create a
printable DataFrame based on the dictionary
